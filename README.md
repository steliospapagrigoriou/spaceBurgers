Space Port Demo App
===================

You are the engineer on a space exploration vessel and while
travelling through the galaxy your ship picks up a broadcast. Your
captain tasks you with decoding the signal and reporting back to her.

You start investigating the signal and quickly realise that it is a
spaceport broadcasting their burger menu. You report the findings back
and your captain gleefully instructs you to build an app that can be
used by the crew to purchase burgers.

Your captain gives you the following list of features required:

* I want to see a list of all available burgers
* I want the specials to be highlighted at the top in a carousel
* I want the prices to be clearly visible
* I want vegetarian burgers to be clearly indicated
* I want to be able to look up the notes on a burger
* I want to be able to purchase burgers
* I want to be able to see the burgers in offline mode
* I want purchasing to be turned off in offline mode
* I want errors while ordering to be handled properly and the error
  message to be displayed


You head off to implement the application for the crew and discover
that the API offers two different modes of operation, GET requests to
list burgers and POST requests to order burgers.

* GET https://space-burgers.herokuapp.com/burgers/
* POST https://space-burgers.herokuapp.com/burgers/

We expect that building this demo app should not take longer than one evening.
If you make any assumptions add comments to your code describing them
and include a paragraph about the choices and decisions you have made
while implementing the application. 


NOTE: GEtting kicked out by the cafe! Half an hour break to find a place to sit :)
EDIT: Back home - had some dinner too
