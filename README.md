Space Port Demo App
===================

Had a couple of hours break for dinner and going from a cafeteria back home. Took me around 5-6 hours all together; took me quite a while to manage redirecting AJAX requests to heroku (ajax doesn't allow to
directly request other servers, you have to make your server act as proxy) and playing around with directives too much and unecesserally.

Most of the assumptions I made, I write them in inline comments!

It was a nice exercise and it was fun - I never had to use some of those things in Angular before and I'm glad I had to speed learn
them this way!

RUN IT: 
bower install
npm install 
grunt serve

Will do the tricks
